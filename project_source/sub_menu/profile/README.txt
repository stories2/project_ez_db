A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ColeTownsend/pen/JDzBp.

 For a current design project. Wanted to work with some real pixels after a day of wireframing. I wouldn't say I design in the browser, but this *is* where it will end up. Sometimes its good to design "in media res".
